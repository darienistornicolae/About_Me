Hello! ðŸ˜Ž

I am an indie iOS engineer with expertise in various programming languages and technologies, including Swift, C# and JavaScript. Throughout my career, I developed mobile apps as a front end developer and deliver them to different entities. In my free time, I developed my personal projects which are publicly avaialble on GitHub. The biggest Achievement that I have is to publish one of my projects to [AppStore]([url](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motiq-ai-quotes-mindfulness/id6447770639))

iOS Development expertise ðŸ’»ðŸ“±

My programming journey began with JavaScript and I swiftly expanded my skills to encompass Swift and various Apple Frameworks in the Apple ecosystem. I have gained considerable experience in working with Swift and its framework, enhancing my ability to build Mobile Apps.

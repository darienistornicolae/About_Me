Hello! ðŸ˜Ž

I am Nicolae, an indie iOS engineer with expertise in various programming languages and technologies, including Swift, C#, and JavaScript. Throughout my career, I developed mobile apps as a front-end developer and deliver them to different entities. In my free time, I developed my projects which are publicly available on GitHub. The biggest achievement that I have is to publish one of my projects to AppStore

My programming journey began with JavaScript and I swiftly expanded my skills to encompass Swift and various Apple Frameworks in the Apple ecosystem. I have gained considerable experience in working with Swift and its framework, enhancing my ability to build Mobile Apps.![swift](https://github.com/darienistornicolae/About_Me/assets/41840484/751278c2-e508-4541-a1e2-cb288d5c6dd7) ![apple-logo](https://github.com/darienistornicolae/About_Me/assets/41840484/6ce936e8-adfe-4d0d-8712-e9db44583904)
